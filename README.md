# Analysis Toolkit Documentation

## Overview
**Analysis Toolkit** is a comprehensive business analysis platform that delivers advanced analytics capabilities for text, files, and web content. The system is structured into three main modules—**File Analysis**, **Website Analysis**, and **Text Analysis**—each offering targeted analytical functionality through an intuitive, web-based interface built with Streamlit.
